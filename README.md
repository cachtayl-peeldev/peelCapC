# NoitomMocapLiveLinkPlugin

Welcome to the Neuron Live Link Unreal Plugin source code!

With the code in this repository, you can build the Unreal Plugin for Windows x64 platform.

## Branches

We publish source for the engine in several branches:

*   The **[master branch](https://github.com/pnmocap/NoitomMocapLiveLinkPlugin/tree/master)** branch always reflects the current official release. These are extensively tested by our QA team.

*   The **[develop branch](https://github.com/pnmocap/NoitomMocapLiveLinkPlugin/tree/develop)** is our developing branch and may get compile error sometimes. if you want to preview new features not committed to master, you can refer to this branch. When things is ready to release we will make a tag (named vx.x.x) in this branch and merge to master.

*   The **[marketplace branch](https://github.com/pnmocap/NoitomMocapLiveLinkPlugin/tree/marketplace)** is the hub of version commited to unreal marketplace

*   Other Branches typically for internal processes, and are rarely useful for end users.
